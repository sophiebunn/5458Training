example + practice for team members who are unfamiliar with FRC command based programming

To start, take the ZIP file from the repo onto your WPILib. Each practice problem has its own folder under java/frc/robot/. There will be a robot.java and a robotcontainer.java file for every problem. These are the ones that you should edit. There will also be text instructions in each folder. A possible solution is included with OneSolution.java files. You may check possible answers here. If needed you can email me to check your code if you are unclear if your code is viable.
